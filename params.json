{"name":"Kuruvindam","tagline":"A Ruby port of the Python/TCOD tutorial on RogueBasin.","body":"# Kuruvindam\r\n\r\nThis is a Ruby port of the game created in [RogueBasin](http://www.roguebasin.com)'s [Complete Roguelike Tutorial, using python+libtcod](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod) using a Ruby binding ([mispy/libtcod](http://github.com/mispy/libtcod)) for the “The Doryen Library”, [libtcod](http://roguecentral.org/doryen/libtcod/) a \"free, fast, portable and uncomplicated API for roguelike developers\". Thanks to @mispy for creating the libtcod binding.\r\n\r\nI'm using it to understand how to write a roguelike (hence the lack of testing, stability and documentation). Once I've got the port working, I'll clean it up and write up a Ruby-flavored version of the tutorial.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\nThis has only been tested under Mac OS X, but in principle should run under any system that can run Ruby 2 and which libtcod supports\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nGrab a copy from github\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/asimy/kuruvindam.git kuruvindam\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo run the game,\r\n\r\n    cd kuruvindam\r\n    ruby kuruvindam.rb\r\n\r\n### Game controls\r\nThese are *very* basic:\r\n\r\n- Arrows keys move your character (currently represented by the classic '@'). Bump into monsters to attack them.\r\n- Esc to exit the game\r\n- option/alt-Return toggles full screen\r\n\r\n## Todo\r\n\r\n- Test on other platforms\r\n- Finish the tutorial\r\n- Fix all the things\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Fork it ( https://github.com/asimy/kuruvindam/fork )\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)\r\n4.
